# Download-and-Labelling-Pipeline
An automated way of downloading and labelling new data for the dataset


An automated way of downloading and labelling new data for the dataset is what is developed in this project.

This will include the full inventory of images for the dataset, as well as a copy with labels, and will allow for seamless labelling of any newly downloaded images.
